# Nicolas Carlo's dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles and configuration files I use to customize my tools.

You need to create symlinks manually, like this:

```sh
ln -s <path-to-dotfiles>/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```

`oh-my-zsh/` should be symlinked to `$HOME`. It's a git submodule, don't forget to pull it first.
